# shinydemo-aws

The goal of this repository is to hold the source code for sample R Shiny applications that is deployed to AWS using CI/CD.

Ideally, the end-product would have:
* A custom URL pointing to the application
* Affiliated with my website's domain name (e.g., somecompany.zajichekstats.com/myapp)
* Security/authentication for app access

Currently deployed to https://apps.zajichekstats.com/
